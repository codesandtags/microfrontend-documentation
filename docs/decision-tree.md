# Decision Tree for Implementing Micro Frontends

## When to use Micro Frontends?

- Your architecture scale with multiple teams working on a single product simultaneously.
- Medium-to-large projects
- Old, large monolith needs to be rebuild
- There are autonomous teams and existing good CI/CD pipelines

## When not to use Micro Frontends?

- Small projects
- Single team working on a single product
- Is not a clear bounded context defined
- Just for fun and add more complexity

The following decision tree provides a structured approach to evaluating whether Micro Frontends are suitable for your project and guiding you through key considerations during implementation.

## 1. Project Scope and Team Structure

**Are different teams working on different parts of the frontend?**

- Yes: Consider Micro Frontends for independent development and deployment.
- No: Stick with a Monolithic Frontend unless other benefits of Micro Frontends are crucial.

## 2. Granularity

**Do you need to split by business domain (e.g., product, checkout, user management)?**

- Yes: Use Vertical Split.
- No: Evaluate other criteria.

## 3. Integration Approach

**Do you require build-time integration for shared resources?**

- Yes: Consider Build-time Integration using tools like Module Federation (Webpack 5).
- No: Proceed to runtime considerations.

## 4. Runtime Integration

**Do you need runtime flexibility and independent deployments?**

- Yes: Use Run-time Integration. Choose between:
  - Client-side Integration (e.g., Single-SPA)
  - Server-side Integration (e.g., Edge Side Includes - ESI)
- No: Build-time integration might suffice.

## 5. Framework and Tool Selection

**Do you have a preferred JavaScript framework?**

- Yes: Ensure the chosen framework is compatible with tools like Single-SPA or Module Federation.
- No: Evaluate the following

  - Single-SPA for a framework-agnostic solution.
  - Module Federation (Webpack 5) for robust module sharing.

## 6. Communication Between Micro Frontends

**Is shared state or global communication required?**

- Yes: Implement Shared State Management using tools like Redux or Context API.
- No: Use Custom Events for loose coupling.

## 7. Deployment Strategy

**Do you need independent deployment pipelines?**

- Yes: Implement Independent Deployment with separate CI/CD pipelines.
- No: Use a Monolithic Deployment pipeline with versioning and coordinated releases.

## 8. Performance Considerations

**Is performance a critical concern?**

- Yes: Optimize with Lazy Loading, Code Splitting, and effective Caching strategies.
- No: Standard optimization techniques can be applied as needed.

## 9. Security Requirements

**Do you have specific security constraints (e.g., CORS, authentication)?**

- Yes: Ensure proper CORS Configuration, implement robust Authentication and Authorization mechanisms.
- No: Apply general security best practices.

## Detailed Decision Points

### Project Scope and Team Structure

- **Independent Teams**: If multiple teams are responsible for different sections of the frontend, Micro Frontends enable them to work autonomously and deploy independently.
  Single Team: If one team handles the entire frontend, the complexity of Micro Frontends might outweigh the benefits.

### Granularity

- **Vertical Split**: Suitable when dividing by business domain, allowing each domain to be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.
- **Horizontal Split**: Consider for technical capabilities or page sections, such as header, footer, or feature flags.

### Integration Approach

- **Build-time Integration**: Suitable when you need tight coupling and shared resources at build time. Tools like Webpackâ€™s Module Federation allow different parts to share code seamlessly.
- **Run-time Integration**: Best for highly dynamic applications where parts need to be integrated at runtime, offering greater flexibility and independent deployments.

### Framework and Tool Selection

- **Single-SPA**: A versatile framework that supports various JavaScript libraries and frameworks, allowing multiple frameworks to coexist in a single application.
- **Module Federation**: Allows dynamic imports and shared modules, promoting reusability and reducing duplication.

### Communication Between Micro Frontends

- **Shared State Management**: For applications requiring a unified state across micro frontends, use state management libraries.
- **Custom Events**: For more decoupled communication, custom events provide a lightweight method for interaction.

### Deployment Strategy

- **Independent Deployment**: Each Micro Frontend can be developed and deployed separately, enabling quicker releases and isolated updates.
- **Monolithic Deployment**: A coordinated approach where all parts are deployed together, suitable for tightly coupled frontends.

### Performance Considerations

- **Lazy Loading**: Load components only when needed to improve initial load times.
- **Code Splitting**: Split code into smaller bundles to optimize load times and performance.
- **Caching**: Implement effective caching strategies to reduce load times and improve user experience.
  Security Requirements
- **CORS**: Properly configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing for secure communication between different origins.
  Authentication/Authorization: Ensure secure user authentication and authorization mechanisms across all Micro Frontends.
